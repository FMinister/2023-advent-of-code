# 2023-advent-of-code

[Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2023/about) is an Advent calendar of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill sets and skill levels that can be solved in any programming language you like. I am going to use this repository to store my solutions to the puzzles. I will be using [Go](https://go.dev/) as my language of choice.
